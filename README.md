## gSchool Alumni Network

This is a JavaScript web app written with React and Meteor. It's my final project for the Galvanize Full Stack program in Denver, CO, USA, completed in about 1 1/2 weeks after 5 months of instruction in the MEAN stack.

The app is a small social network for the purpose of connecting gSchool alumni. Users can log in and create a profile with their basic information, create a to-do list with deadlines, and save other users' information to a contact list. They can also add a list of their skills and interests to their profile, from which they will be matched with other users with similar profiles.

Future features will include drag-and-drop functionality from skills and interests lists to the to-do list, embedded code snippets, job listings, OAuth integration with LinkedIn and Github, and activity notifications.
