## gSchool Alumni Network

This is a JavaScript web app written with React and Meteor. It's my final project for the Galvanize Full Stack program in Denver, CO, USA, completed in about 1 1/2 weeks after 5 months of instruction in the MEAN stack.

This app is a final project for the Galvanize Full Stack program in Denver, CO, USA. The app is a small social network that connects gSchool alumni so they can learn from each other and help each other with their job search. Users create a profile with their basic information, make a to-do list with deadlines, and save another user's profile to a contact list. They can also add a list of their skills and career interests to their profile, which are used to match them with similar alumni.

Future features will include more embedded messaging options, a more robust profile for enhanced contact recommendations, resource forums, and private job boards.
